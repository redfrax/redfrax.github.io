I'm a cloud and infrastructure consultant working for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com).  
Currently my scope is delivering Red Hat technologies both at customers premises and on cloud, having Openshift Container Platform as the main focus.  
Working closely with customers and helping them during the journey of the automation process are other satisfying aspects of my job.  
There's no need to say I'm a tech enthusiast always seeking new tech trends, but I'm also a sport shooter and guns lover.
